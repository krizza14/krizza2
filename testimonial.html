            <p> Lifelong learning is to embrace that the learning journey never ends, and that each day presents opportunities for us to follow our passions and curiosities. That means we do not have to pick a path early in life and stick to it, and we are capable of change, growth and redirection at any time. So as this Extension Project of College of Computer Studies in Northern Bukidnon State College opens an opportunity to us Community ALS Implementers to empower our Digital Literacy.

In todayâ€™s digital world we educators should have enough skills and knowledge about computer since this is one of the useful and easy tools to use when teaching. It will help us drive towards digitalization, has transformed teaching resources, giving greater emphasis to dynamism and student interaction with the subject matter. It incorporates new learning methods, new teaching methodologies, thus improving academic results and encouraging dynamism in the classroom. Moreover, their use implies the development of the digital skills needed to avoid the digital divide.  
            
           Overall, this extension project was of great help to us educators for this opens our horizon in digital world. We emptied our cap since we started this training but now we are about to end it filled our bucket with knowledge of digital citizenship.
